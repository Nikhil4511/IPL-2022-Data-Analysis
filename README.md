## 🏏 IPL 2022 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 season. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from match-level data to understand how factors such as venue, toss decisions, team strategy (batting/fielding), and match outcomes influence winning probability.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze match outcomes across different venues

- Study the impact of toss decisions on match results

- Compare batting first vs fielding first strategies

- Identify venue-wise winning patterns

- Provide decision-making insights that can improve win probability

## 📂 Dataset Description

- Source: IPL 2022 Match Dataset

- Format: CSV

- Granularity: Match-level data

## Key Columns:

- match_id – Unique match identifier

- venue – Match venue

- team1, team2 – Competing teams

- toss_winner – Team that won the toss

- toss_decision – Bat or Field

- winner – Match winner

- win_by_runs / win_by_wickets – Margin of victory

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

- NumPy – Numerical analysis

- Matplotlib & Plotly – Data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook – Analysis & documentation

## 📊 Analysis Performed

Venue-wise match distribution

Toss decision vs winning percentage

Batting first vs fielding first success rate

Team performance trends across venues

Visual insights using bar charts & pie charts

## 🔍 Key Insights

Certain venues show a clear advantage for teams fielding first

Toss decisions significantly impact match outcomes at specific grounds

Batting first is not always the optimal strategy—context matters

Teams adapting strategy based on venue conditions have higher win rates
